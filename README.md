# About Me

<br>
I am a computational biologist based in SF Bay Area.<br>
My interests include: leveraging machine learning to analyze multiomics data for improving patient prognosis, precision medicine, and DEI outreach--in both education and health equity.<br><br>

Prior to this, I obtained my PhD in Genetics at [UCSF](https://tetrad.ucsf.edu/) working in the context of systems neuroscience in [Evan Feinberg's lab](http://www.evanfeinberglab.com/).<br> 
My thesis project resulted in 2 **first-author** publications:<br>

> [*Virally Encoded Connectivity Transgenic Overlay RNA sequencing (VECTORseq) defines projection neurons involved in sensorimotor integration.*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.110131) Victoria Cheung; Philip Chung; Max Bjorni; Varvara Shvareva; Yesenia Lopez; Evan H Feinberg<br>

> [*Transcriptional profiling of mouse projection neurons with VECTORseq.*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2022.101625) Victoria Cheung; Philip Chung; Evan H Feinberg<br>
<br>

During graduate school, I spent 2 months in a health data science fellowship where I devised my own research question to independently build a predictive clinical calculator as a deliverable MVP--[blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-acute-kidney-injury-in-hospitalized-patients-53ca07525e67?gi=619e89828b8e).<br>
I then spent 6 months at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) mentored by [Kevin Walsh](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin-Walsh-3) and [Robert Piskol](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4dgMpSAAAAAJ&hl=en) as an oncology bioinformatics intern; where I characterized gene signature development and refinement for T cell signaling pathways in cancer models.
