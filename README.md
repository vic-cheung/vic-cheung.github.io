# About Me


I am an interdisciplinary data scientist with a PhD in Genetics, specializing in computational biology, multi-omics analysis, and machine learning. I have hands-on experience developing scalable data pipelines, integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, and deploying machine learning models for cancer detection, disease monitoring, and evaluating treatment response. I work with cross-functional teams to apply data science in driving scientific discovery and innovation.
