# About Me
* * *
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I am currently a computational biologist based in South San Francisco.
My interests include: leveraging machine learning to analyze multiomics data for improving patient prognosis, precision medicine, and DEI outreach--in education and health equity.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Prior to this, I obtained my PhD in Genetics at [UCSF](https://tetrad.ucsf.edu/) working in the context of systems neuroscience in [Evan Feinberg's lab](http://www.evanfeinberglab.com/). I spent 2 months in a health data science fellowship building a predictive clinical calculator--[blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-acute-kidney-injury-in-hospitalized-patients-53ca07525e67?gi=619e89828b8e) and spent 6 months at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) mentored by [Kevin Walsh](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin-Walsh-3) and [Robert Piskol](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4dgMpSAAAAAJ&hl=en) as an oncology bioinformatics intern; where I characterized gene signature development and refinement for T cell signaling pathways in cancer models.
